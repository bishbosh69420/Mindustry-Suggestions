**Describe the content or mechanics you are proposing.**
when copy and pasting, or using schematics, the data from a message block should copy to.


**Describe how you think this content will improve the game. If you're proposing new content, mention how it may add more gameplay options or how it will fill a new niche.**
if a schematic seems complicated or it needs it, you can implement a message block into it telling the user what to do. if you don't want an area to be touched in multiplayer or something of the liking, you can use a message block,
type what needs to be done and then copy that to a few locations instead of having to re-type it or copy and paste the actual message instead of it. it would make copying message blocks a lot less tedious.  


**Before making this issue, replace the spaces in the following boxes with an `X` to confirm that you have acknowledged them.** *Failure to do so may result in your request being closed automatically.*



1. - [x] I have done a quick search in the list of suggestions to make sure this has not been suggested yet.
2. - [x] I have checked the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/aE2tcUwF/mindustry-trello) to make sure my suggestion isn't planned or implemented in a development version.
3. - [x] I am familiar with all the content already in the game or have glanced at the wiki to make sure my suggestion doesn't exist in the game yet.
